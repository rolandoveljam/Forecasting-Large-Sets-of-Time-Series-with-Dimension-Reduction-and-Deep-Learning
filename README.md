# Forecasting-Large-Sets-of-Time-Series-with-Dimension-Reduction-and-Deep-Learning

The file \texttt{Chapter\_5\_simulation.R} contains the code for the simulation study in Chapter 5, comparing \texttt{forecast} and \texttt{SLBDD}. The files \texttt{Chapter\_6\_experiment.R} and \texttt{Chapter\_6\_experiment.ipynb} include the code for the computational experiment in Chapter 6, covering dynamic factor models and deep neural networks, respectively. The file \texttt{dfmpcN.R} holds an adapted function used in \texttt{Chapter\_6\_experiment.R}. Finally, the folder \texttt{Model predictions} contains various CSV files with the predictions from the R models (\texttt{Chapter\_6\_experiment.R}), enabling combined visualizations in Python in \texttt{Chapter\_6\_experiment.ipynb}.
