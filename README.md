# Forecasting-Large-Sets-of-Time-Series-with-Dimension-Reduction-and-Deep-Learning

The file *Chapter\_5\_simulation.R* contains the code for the simulation study in Chapter 5, comparing *forecast* and *SLBDD*. The files *Chapter\_6\_experiment.R* and *Chapter\_6\_experiment.ipynb* include the code for the computational experiment in Chapter 6, covering dynamic factor models and deep neural networks, respectively. The file *dfmpcN.R* holds an adapted function used in *Chapter\_6\_experiment.R*. Finally, the folder *Model predictions* contains various CSV files with the predictions from the R models (*Chapter\_6\_experiment.R*), enabling combined visualizations in Python in *Chapter\_6\_experiment.ipynb*.
